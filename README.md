# EarthquakeAPI

In this project I made a .NET and Angular web app using an earthquakes API to be able to generate a list of the last earthquakes that happend on a specific magnitude and period of time, also it generates the last earthquake from Romania in the last 6 mounths using a user- friendly interface.
